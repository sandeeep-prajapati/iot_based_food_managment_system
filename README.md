# Leftover Food Donation Portal

I'm excited to share my latest project: an IoT-based solution to donate leftover food efficiently and effectively. 🍽️💡

## How It Works

1. **Food Detection**: 
   - Place leftover food in a designated box equipped with a micro-controller (ESP8266) and an ultrasonic sensor. 
   - If food is detected, data is sent to the server. 📦🔍📡

2. **Notification System**: 
   - The server informs food box indicators with LED lights. 
   - If food is available within a 2 km range, the LED turns on; otherwise, it stays off. 💻🔔💡

3. **Assistance for Non-Mobile Users**: 
   - Individuals without mobile or internet access can request help from others to check for nearby food availability within a 2 km range. 🤝📱🌐

4. **Web Interface**: 
   - A user-friendly web interface displays images, locations, landmarks, contact details, addresses, and descriptions of available food. 🖥️🌍📸

5. **Food Collection**: 
   - Once food is taken from a box, the LED light turns off, and the data is automatically removed from the website. 🍽️💡🗑️

## The Story Behind This Project

My family and I were deeply moved by a documentary on the global food crisis, highlighting that approximately 800 million people lack adequate food. Inspired to make a difference, I developed this technology for better food management and distribution. 🎥🍲📉

## Technology Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Backend**: MySQL, Laravel
- **IoT Devices**: ESP8266, Ultrasonic Sensor, LED Light, Jumper Wires, Breadboard, Batteries

## Website Features

- Generate a code for your food donation box.
- Search for available food within a 2 km range.
- Easy and intuitive user design.
- Automated records maintained by IoT devices.
- Integrated system design utilizing IoT and web technology.

## Future Aspirations

I am continuously enhancing features like using loudspeakers instead of LED lights and integrating AI models to predict the correct amount of food to cook for events. 📢🧠🌟
